# fluct-moving-habitat-model
This repository goes hand-in-hand with the manuscript "Fluctuations in climate change can benefit population abundance and their spatial range". 

Each folder is associated to a figure within the manuscript and contains information needed to recreate the figures.

All script is written with MATLAB and all solutions are found via the finite difference scheme developed in MacDonald et al 2021.
