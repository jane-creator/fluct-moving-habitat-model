# fluct-moving-habitat-model
This repository goes hand-in-hand with the manuscript "Fluctuations in climate change can benefit population abundance and their spatial range". 

Each folder, let's call each one a Figure Folder, is associated to a figure within the manuscript and contains the files that are needed to recreate that figure. Within each Figure Folder one will find file contents and more folders. With the file contents, one can directly recreate the figure with the solutions from simulations already there. Additionally, the folders contain the files necessary to run the simulations to recreate those solutions.

All script is written with MATLAB and all solutions are found via the finite difference scheme developed in MacDonald et al 2021.
