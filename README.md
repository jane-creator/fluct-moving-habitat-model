# fluct-moving-habitat-model
This repository goes hand-in-hand with the manuscript "Fluctuations in climate change can benefit population abundance and their spatial range". 

Each folder is associated to a figure within the manuscript and contains the files that are needed to recreate that figure. Within each folder you will find the files necessary to simulate the model dynamics and then additionally recreate the figure. 

All script is written with MATLAB and all solutions are found via the finite difference scheme developed in MacDonald et al 2021.
